# Four-piece chess 
This is my first time write a public Repo readme.   
maybe sth. will missing...
## Project background
This is an assignment from a basic programming course, completed on [2024/11].   
Enter the coordinates as numbers, place a piece at that location,   
and one side must chain four pieces together to become the winner. The game is settled after this.
If the board is full and neither side has achieved victory, a draw will occur.

## How to play?
- clone the project

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Friedrice3/Four-piece-chess.git
```
- run game
```bash
    cd GameCore
    java four_piece_chess.java
```
then you will see a checkerboard like this

```
0|  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
1|  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
2|  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0

    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
player 1's turn.
Enter row and column (e.g., 0 1):
```
try to enter some number like ```0 1``` ```9 1```   
Then you'll see the corresponding player's pieces appear at the corresponding coordinates.


## Post-completion insights
It is currently 2026/1.   
It has been almost two years since I completed this assignment.   
To be honest, a lot of the code here runs, but it's very inelegant; there are better solutions.   
But I don't plan to make major changes to the original code;    
I'll just keep it as a youthful memory（？）.
